/** NOTE
 *  This is the singleton class that contains the list of providers for the abstraction layer.
 *  It also contains the methods to register new providers.
 *
 *  INFO for developers:
 *  - The providers can be registered by adding a new provider registration file in the ./index.ts file.
 *  - The provider registration files use the registerEVM and registerChainProviders methods to register the providers.
 *  - The registerEVM method takes a chainId and an array of RPC URLs as arguments.
 *  - The registerChainProviders method takes a chain type, a network, and an array of RPC URLs as arguments.
 *  - For an example of how to register a new provider, see the ./ankr.ts file.
 *  - The Providers.ts file export the singleton instance of the AbstractionProviders class, already registered with all providers.
 *
 *  NOTE: The Providers object should only used internally (e.g. in EvmCoinFinder.ts and CoinFinder.ts).
 * This is due to the fact that it is initialized with all the providers at runtime.
